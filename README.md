Geofencing with Python.



This is an attempt to make geofencing with Python a bit easier.
Using the point-in-polygon theory, it will (sometimes already can) work out if a given geographical point (lat / long) is within a fence.
A fence is defined as a series of geographical points, of which the order is important.
